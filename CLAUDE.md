# CLAUDE.md — jUCMNav modernization

This file orients every Claude Code session working in this repo. Read it before
making changes.

## What this project is

jUCMNav is an Eclipse plug-in (graphical editor + analysis tool) for the User
Requirements Notation (URN), combining Use Case Maps (UCM) and the Goal-oriented
Requirements Language (GRL). It is built on **EMF** (model) and **GEF Classic**
(diagram editors), and uses **MDT/OCL** for constraints. It is a classic PDE
plug-in: `MANIFEST.MF`, `plugin.xml`, an EMF model under `model/`
(`.ecore` + `.genmodel`), and editor code under `src/`.

The project last built reliably on the legacy
[`JUCMNAV/projetseg-update`](https://github.com/JUCMNAV/projetseg-update)
repo in 2018, had a partial fix attempt in 2020, then sat broken for years
against modern Java/Eclipse with no working deployment. **Phase A
(compile-clean) and Phase B (QA bug hunt) of the modernization are now
complete** and shipping from `master` against Java 21 / Eclipse 2026-03,
with the p2 update site published continuously to
`https://jucmnav.github.io/jUCMNavPlus/` via GitHub Pages. The JUnit suite
gates every push.

When you arrive in a fresh session, expect a working build, not a rescue
project. The targets and golden rules below still apply — they're what
kept the modernization from drifting into a rewrite — but the "predicted
compile errors" framing in MIGRATION_ERRORS.md is now historical record,
not a TODO list.

## Targets (do not change without asking)

- **Java 21 LTS** — source/target level 21. Do NOT raise the language level past 21.
- **Eclipse 2026-03 (4.39)** platform, via the p2 release repo.
- **GEF Classic 3.x** (the maintained continuation) — NOT GEF4/Zest. Keep the
  existing EditPart/Figure/draw2d code; migrate, don't rewrite.
- **Tycho 5.0.3** for the command-line build and the p2 update site.

## Golden rules

1. **The build is the source of truth.** Don't reason about Eclipse/EMF/GEF APIs
   from memory — they have drifted over 20 years. Compile, read the actual
   errors, fix, recompile.
2. **Never hand-edit generated EMF code.** If model code is wrong, fix the
   `.ecore`/`.genmodel` and regenerate. Generated files are recognizable by the
   `@generated` tag. Hand-written extensions use `@generated NOT` — preserve those.
3. **Small, compilable, single-purpose commits.** One error cluster per commit so
   regressions can be bisected. Don't batch unrelated fixes.
4. **Preserve behavior.** This is a migration, not a redesign. If a fix changes
   what the tool does (e.g. a GRL evaluation result), stop and flag it for human
   review rather than guessing.
5. **Prefer the smallest change that compiles and runs.** Don't refactor for style
   while migrating.

## Build & run

```bash
# Full headless build + tests + p2 update site:
mvn -B clean verify

# The installable update site (p2 repository) lands here:
#   seg.jUCMNav.repository/target/repository
```

`verify` runs the JUnit suite under `seg.jUCMNav.tests/` (an
`eclipse-test-plugin` fragment of `seg.jUCMNav`) inside a headless Eclipse UI
harness. **Test failures fail the build.** On Linux the workbench needs a
display, so CI wraps `mvn` in `xvfb-run`. Pass `-DskipTests` to skip tests
locally if you only want the update site.

### The fast local loop

The full gate is ~6.5 minutes and almost all of it is the suite itself, so
the way to iterate quickly is to run fewer tests, not to build less:

```bash
mvn -B -o verify -pl seg.jUCMNav,seg.jUCMNav.tests -Dtest=StubExtractionScopeTest -DfailIfNoTests=false
```

That is **~50 seconds**, against ~6m30 for everything. Measured on the
2026-08-02 tree (395 tests):

| command | time |
|---|---|
| `mvn -B clean verify` (the gate) | ~7 min |
| same without `clean`, two modules | 6m26 |
| one test class, `-o`, two modules | 48 s |

What each flag buys, so you can drop the ones you don't need:

- `-Dtest=Foo` (comma-separated for several, `-DfailIfNoTests=false` so a
  module with no match doesn't fail) — this is the whole win. The suite is
  ~5.5 min of the 6.5.
- `-pl seg.jUCMNav,seg.jUCMNav.tests` skips the feature and the p2
  repository, which you almost never need locally. Both modules are
  required: the test fragment cannot resolve its host from the repo alone.
- no `clean` — Tycho recompiles incrementally. Use `clean` when changing
  `MANIFEST.MF`, `build.properties` or the target platform.
- `-o` (offline) skips remote metadata checks, worth a few seconds.

The residual ~45 s is Tycho target-platform resolution plus starting an
OSGi framework, and is paid once per invocation — so batch classes into one
`-Dtest=` rather than running several commands.

Test classes cannot run in parallel: `useUIThread=true` puts everything on
the workbench's UI thread.

### What each class actually costs

Pick from this rather than guessing — the intuition that "a test that
checks thousands of cases must be slow" is wrong here, and the reverse is
usually true. Figures from the 10.0.7 CI run and a local run of the same
commit; the command-heavy classes were carrying a ~15% regression in that
run (fixed straight after, see `MultiPageCommandStackListener`), so read
them as an upper bound:

| Class | CI | local | what makes it cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JUCMNavCommandTests` | 393 s | 47 s | drives the workbench through every command |
| `JUCMNavGRLCommandTests` | 206 s | 57 s | same, for GRL |
| `JUCMNavKPICommandTests` | 139 s | 11 s | same, for KPIs |
| `ExtractStubFromSampleTest` | 100 s | 8 s | opens an editor **per test method** |
| `GlobalUndoSurvivesUnrelatedEditTest` | 73 s | 14 s | ditto, plus a second map each time |
| `RefactorIntoStubUndoTest` | 47 s | 3 s | ditto |
| `ProgressTests` | 12 s | 46 s | — |
| `ScenarioTraversalTests` | 7 s | 21 s | — |
| `ExtractStubScenarioRoundTripTest` | 6 s | 11 s | one editor, reused across 30 traversals |
| `StubExtractionScopeTest` | **0.18 s** | 0.35 s | 29 tests, one of which sweeps all 2048 subsets of a sample map |
| `jUCMNavParserTest` | 0.08 s | 0.25 s | 116 tests, pure parsing |

The cost is **opening editors**, not the number of assertions. A class that
loads a model into a `UCMNavMultiPageEditor` in `@Before` pays for it once
per test method; one that queries the model directly runs thousands of
cases for free. `StubExtractionScopeTest` checks 2048 subsets in under a
fifth of a second because `StubExtractionScope` is a pure query with no
workbench behind it — write new coverage at that level whenever the thing
under test allows it, and reserve editor-driven tests for behaviour that
genuinely needs the workbench.

Note also that CI and local disagree about which classes are slow (compare
`ProgressTests` with `JUCMNavKPICommandTests`), so profile where you care
rather than assuming the other environment matches.

**Run the full `mvn -B clean verify` before any push.** The scoped run is
for the edit loop, not for the gate.

In the IDE: import all four (now five) Maven modules as existing projects,
set the target platform to `seg.jUCMNav.target/seg.jUCMNav.target`, then
Run As → Eclipse Application to launch a runtime workbench. For tests,
right-click any class under `seg.jUCMNav.tests/src/` (or the `src/` folder
itself) → Run As → JUnit Plug-in Test.

`.classpath` **is committed** (issue #3, settled on Option A). It is the
canonical IDE source-path definition — in particular it marks `src/` as the
source folder (without it Eclipse treats the project root as source and every
package mismatches, e.g. `asd` vs `src.asd`) and carries the access-rule block
that lets `seg.jUCMNav/src/seg/jUCMNav/views/search/` reach the `x-internal`
`org.eclipse.search.internal.ui.text.*` types. Option C (gitignore it, let the
IDE regenerate) was tried and reverted: with `custom = true` in
`build.properties`, fresh imports do not self-heal the source folder. Do NOT
"convert to automatic manifest generation" — the `MANIFEST.MF` is hand-authored
and authoritative. The Tycho CLI build never reads `.classpath`.

## Repo layout (after scaffolding)

- `seg.jUCMNav/` — the plug-in (existing code). Pomless: built from its MANIFEST.MF.
- `seg.jUCMNav.tests/` — JUnit 3 test fragment (Fragment-Host: seg.jUCMNav).
  `eclipse-test-plugin` packaging; needs a `pom.xml` since pomless does not
  infer that packaging type.
- `seg.jUCMNav.feature/` — the installable feature (what users select).
- `seg.jUCMNav.repository/` — produces the p2 update site (`category.xml`).
- `seg.jUCMNav.target/` — target platform definition (pinned to 2026-03).
- `pom.xml` — Tycho parent/aggregator.
- `.mvn/extensions.xml` — enables Tycho pomless builds.
- `.github/workflows/` — CI build + tests + publish update site to GitHub Pages.

## Known migration hotspots (verify each against real errors)

- **`Bundle-RequiredExecutionEnvironment`** in `MANIFEST.MF`: change `J2SE-1.5`
  (or similar) to `JavaSE-21`.
- **Removed JDK APIs** — the most likely compile-breakers:
  - JAXB (`javax.xml.bind.*`) was removed from the JDK after Java 8. If Z.151
    XML import/export uses it, add Jakarta XML Binding as an explicit dependency.
  - `com.sun.*` / `sun.misc.*` internals — replace with supported APIs.
- **`Require-Bundle` / `Import-Package` version ranges** that no longer resolve
  against the 2026-03 platform.
- **MDT/OCL**: the `org.eclipse.ocl` API shifted significantly across versions —
  expect this to need real work, not mechanical fixes. Flag it early.
- **Eclipse 3.x → 4.x platform**: deprecated action-set/`IActionDelegate`
  patterns, Forms API, assorted workbench calls. Fix compile-blockers first;
  defer deprecation-only warnings.
- **Third-party export libs** (PDF/SVG/reporting jars, e.g. iText/Batik): may
  need updated OSGi-friendly versions.

## Workflow expectation

Phase A (the burn-down captured in `MIGRATION_ERRORS.md`) is complete.
Phase B (the static bug-hunt captured in `QA_FINDINGS.md`) is complete.
Ongoing work is one-off bug fixes, UI polish, and triage of issues
inherited from `JUCMNAV/projetseg-update` (see
`docs/legacy-issue-triage.md`).

In a fresh session, work the same way the modernization did:
- Small, single-purpose commits. One root cause per commit.
- **Never push.** The user always runs `git push` themselves; the agent
  stops after committing. Recommend a target branch (see below) in the
  wrap-up if a push is warranted, but never perform it.
- Run `mvn -B clean verify` before any push to `master` — it's a hard
  gate, not advisory. Zero failures must hold; the test count grows, so
  compare against the previous run rather than a number written here.
- If the user says "test suite is irrelevant for this change" you can
  build with `mvn -B clean package -DskipTests` to iterate faster; re-run
  the full gate before the user's push.
- When a push is warranted, recommend `modernization` first; `master` is a
  fast-follow only when the user explicitly asks for it. CI on `master`
  triggers the Pages deploy, so be deliberate.

## Do not

- Do not bump the Java language level above 21.
- Do not switch GEF Classic to GEF4/Zest.
- Do not edit `@generated` EMF files by hand.
- Do not introduce network calls, telemetry, or new runtime dependencies without
  asking.
- Do not silence errors by deleting features/tests — fix or explicitly flag them.
